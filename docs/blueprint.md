# **App Name**: Supply Chain Navigator

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Summary Generation: Integrate a tool using a Large Language Model that can generate descriptions or summaries of particular links in the supply chain on demand. The tool should decide when to use quantitative data from the dataset in order to augment the generated summary.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Midnight blue (#2C3E50) for a professional, trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F3F4), subtly desaturated for easy viewing.
- Accent color: Teal (#3498DB) to highlight interactive elements and key information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable interface.
- Use clean, geometric icons to represent different entities and functions within the supply chain visualization.
- Subtle transitions and animations to improve user experience, such as highlighting paths or nodes on hover.
